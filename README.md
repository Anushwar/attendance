Managing student attendance during lecture periods is a difficult challenge. The ability to
compute the attendance percentage becomes a major task as manual computation produces
errors, and wastes a lot of time. For the stated reason, an efficient Web-based application
for attendance management system is designed to track studentâ€™s attendance in the class.

There are involvement of three end users while the web app is used:
- An admin user to manage classes, timetables, students, teachers and enrollment.
- A teacher user who observes the status of attendance of a class and mark attendance. 
- A student user who checks the attendance of themselves.
